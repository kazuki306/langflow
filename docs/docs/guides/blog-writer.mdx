# Blog writer

Build a blog writer with OpenAI that uses URLs for reference content.

## Prerequisites

1. Install Langflow.
```bash
python -m pip install langflow --pre
```

2. Start a local Langflow instance with the Langflow CLI:
```bash
langflow run
```
Or start Langflow with Python:
```bash
python -m langflow run
```

Result:
```bash
â”‚ Welcome to â›“ Langflow                             â”‚
â”‚                                                   â”‚
â”‚ Access http://127.0.0.1:7860                      â”‚
â”‚ Collaborate, and contribute at our GitHub Repo ðŸš€ â”‚
```

Alternatively, go to [HuggingFace Spaces](https://docs.langflow.org/getting-started/hugging-face-spaces) or [Lightning.ai Studio](https://lightning.ai/ogabrielluiz-8j6t8/studios/langflow) for a pre-built Langflow test environment.

3. Create an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com).

## Create the Blog Writer project

1. From the Langflow dashboard, click **New Project**.
2. Select **Blog Writer**.
3. The **Blog Writer** flow is created.

<ZoomableImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: "img/blog-writer.png",
    dark: "img/blog-writer.png",
  }}
  style={{ width: "80%", margin: "20px auto" }}
/>

This flow creates a one-shot prompt flow with **Prompt**, **OpenAI**, and **Chat Output** components, and augments the flow with reference content and instructions from the **URL** and **Instructions** components.

The **Prompt** component's default **Template** field looks like this:
```bash
Reference 1:

{reference_1}

---

Reference 2:

{reference_2}

---

{instructions}

Blog:

```

The `{instructions}` value is received from the **Value** field of the **Instructions** component.
The `reference_1` and `reference_2` values are received from the **URL** fields of the **URL** components.

4. To create an environment variable for the **OpenAI** component, in the **OpenAI API Key** field, click the **Globe** button, and then click **Add New Variable**.
    1. In the **Variable Name** field, enter `openai_api_key`.
    2. In the **Value** field, paste your OpenAI API Key (`sk-...`).
    3. Click **Save Variable**.

## Run the Blog Writer flow

1. Click the **Run** button.
The **Interaction Panel** opens, where you can run your one-shot flow.
2. Click the **Lighting Bolt** icon to run your flow.
3. The **OpenAI** component constructs a blog post with the **URL** items as context.
The default **URL** values are for web pages at `promptingguide.ai`, so your blog post will be about prompting LLMs.

To write about something different, change the values in the **URL** components, and see what the LLM constructs.
