# Basic prompting

Prompts serve as the inputs to a large language model (LLM), acting as the interface between human instructions and computational tasks.

By submitting natural language requests in a prompt to an LLM, you can obtain answers, generate text, and solve problems.

This article demonstrates how to use Langflow's prompt tools to issue basic prompts to an LLM, and how various prompting strategies can affect your outcomes.

## Prerequisites

1. Install Langflow.
```bash
python -m pip install langflow --pre
```

2. Start a local Langflow instance with the Langflow CLI:
```bash
langflow run
```
Or start Langflow with Python:
```bash
python -m langflow run
```

Result:
```

Alternatively, go to [HuggingFace Spaces](https://docs.langflow.org/getting-started/hugging-face-spaces) or [Lightning.ai Studio](https://lightning.ai/ogabrielluiz-8j6t8/studios/langflow) for a pre-built Langflow test environment.

3. Create an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com).

## Create the basic prompting project

1. From the Langflow dashboard, click **New Project**.
2. Select **Basic Prompting**.
3. The **Basic Prompting** flow is created.

<ZoomableImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: "img/basic-prompting.png",
    dark: "img/basic-prompting.png",
  }}
  style={{ width: "80%", margin: "20px auto" }}
/>

This flow allows you to chat with the **OpenAI** component via a **Prompt** component.
Examine the **Prompt** component. The **Template** field instructs the LLM to `Answer the user as if you were a pirate.`
This should be interesting...

4. To create an environment variable for the **OpenAI** component, in the **OpenAI API Key** field, click the **Globe** button, and then click **Add New Variable**.
    1. In the **Variable Name** field, enter `openai_api_key`.
    2. In the **Value** field, paste your OpenAI API Key (`sk-...`).
    3. Click **Save Variable**.

## Run the basic prompting flow

1. Click the **Run** button.
The **Interaction Panel** opens, where you can converse with your bot.
2. Type a message and press Enter.
The bot responds in a markedly piratical manner!

## Modify the prompt for a different result

1. To modify your prompt results, in the **Prompt** template, click the **Template** field.
The **Edit Prompt** window opens.
2. Change `Answer the user as if you were a pirate` to a different character, perhaps `Answer the user as if you were Harold Abelson.`
3. Run the basic prompting flow again.
The response will be markedly different.
