</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

Langflow requires the following programs installed on your system.

* [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)

* [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) or [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/)

## Install Langflow

To install Langflow:

pip:
```bash
python -m pip install langflow -U
```

pipx:
```bash
pipx install langflow --python python3.10 --fetch-missing-python
```
Pipx can fetch the missing Python version for you with `--fetch-missing-python`, but you can also install the Python version manually.


## Install Langflow pre-release

Use `--force-reinstall` to ensure you have the latest version of Langflow and its dependencies.

To install a pre-release version of Langflow:

pip:
```bash
python -m pip install langflow --pre --force-reinstall
```

pipx:
```bash
pipx install langflow --python python3.10 --fetch-missing-python --pip-args="--pre --force-reinstall"
```
