# ðŸ¤— HuggingFace Spaces

Hugging Face provides a great alternative for running Langflow in their Spaces environment. This means you can run Langflow without any local installation required.

The first step is to go to the [Langflow Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Langflow/Langflow?duplicate=true) or [Langflow 1.0 Preview Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Langflow/Langflow-Preview?duplicate=true)

Remember to use a Chromium-based browser for the best experience. You'll be presented with the following screen:

<ZoomableImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: "img/duplicate-space.png",
    dark: "img/duplicate-space.png",
  }}
  style={{ width: "100%", margin: "20px auto" }}
/>

From here, just name your Space, define the visibility (Public or Private), and click on `Duplicate Space` to start the installation process. When that is done, you'll be redirected to the Space's main page to start using Langflow right away!

Once you get Langflow running, click on New Project in the top right corner of the screen. Langflow provides a range of example flows to help you get started.

To quickly try one of them, open a starter example, set up your API keys and click âš¡ Run, on the bottom right corner of the canvas. This will open up Langflow's Interaction Panel with the chat console, text inputs, and outputs.
